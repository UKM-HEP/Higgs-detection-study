# Datasets

The data source is the file training.csv. It contains the data for this example in CSV (comma-separated values) format. The number of columns is 28, and the number of rows is 10012.

The data set consists of 11 million simulated events using the official ATLAS full detector simulator. For this example, we have reduced the instances to around 10000. The proton-proton collisions are simulated based on all scientists' knowledge of particle physics. Next, the resulting particles from the collisions are tracked through a virtual model of the detector.

Each event is described by 28 different features, such as the estimated mass of the Higgs boson candidate or the missing transverse energy.
